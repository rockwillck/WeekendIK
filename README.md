# W-IK-end Project
Yes, I'm aware that's the lamest possible title ever.  
## So... what?
This is the most barebones IK demo ever, but one that has the simple math needed to create as complex a system as you could need.  
It was made in the span of - quite literally - 10 minutes, from 7:35 to 7:45 on Sunday, July 30th.  
## So... why?
IK can seem really, really daunting. Sure, lots of engines and softwares often take care of IK for you, but in the end, it's all just triangle math. You can read through this hastily written code if you'd like - which you'll find is only **37** lines.  
Speaking of those 37 lines, the actual IK code is a total of... 2 lines. Everything else is boilerplate HTML Canvas code that let's me draw this bare bones demo to your screen.
## So... license?
Why you would want to use my code, I don't know. If you do, this project is licensed under **CC0**.
## So... demo?
You can find the online version - if your computer somehow lacks the handful of kilobytes needed to download the HTML yourself (which at that point, seek help) - [here](https://www.rockwill.dev/WeekendIK).
